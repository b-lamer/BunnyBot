Lettuce? I’m listening.
Did someone say lettuce? Where?
Lettuce is always a good idea
Lettuce is life
I could hop for some lettuce right now
Lettuce, you say? I’m on my way
Lettuce just makes everything better
Did someone mention fresh lettuce? I’m sold
Lettuce is just... chef’s kiss
I could commit a felony for some lettuce
Fresh lettuce makes my fur feel shinier
I dream of fields of lettuce
I would trade my kids for some lettuce
Lettuce is the finest snack
If it’s lettuce, I’m interested
Lettuce? You’ve got my attention
Lettuce always makes the perfect snack
I would hop across the yard for some fresh lettuce
Did you say lettuce? You know what I like.
Lettuce is a rabbit’s best friend
I hear lettuce and my ears perk up
Fresh lettuce makes my day
Lettuce always hits the spot
Lettuce? Count me in
Lettuce is the highlight of my day
Carrots? You have my full attention.
Carrots are my favorite. Tell me more.
Oh, carrots? I could snack on those all day
Carrots are crunchy perfection
You’ve got carrots? I’ll be right there
Carrots and I go way back
Carrots are basically my love language
I'm not gay, but 5 carrots is 5 carrots 
Carrots are my main motivation
What’s life without carrots?
Just imagining a carrot inside me right now is making me woozy
A carrot a day keeps me hopping
If you have carrots, I’m coming over
Carrots are the key to my happiness
A carrot a day keeps me smiling
Carrots are like sunshine in a vegetable
I hop extra fast when I see carrots
Carrots are the best part of the garden
I could nibble on carrots all day long
There’s nothing better than a crisp carrot
I’m always in the mood for carrots
Carrots are my ultimate treat
If it’s carrots, I’m all in
Carrots make me feel like royalty
I’d hop any distance for a fresh carrot
Carrots are my kind of snack
Carrots and lettuce are all I need in life
