Bot is very simple in nature due to extreme limits of Twitter's Free API.
### If you want to use this (for some reason):
- Install tweepy
- Make a new project/bot/api thing in the twitter developer platform
- Make sure the bot has read/write access in the developer platform console
- Just add your twitter API credentials in config.py
- And if you'd like, customize the tweets in tweets.txt to whatever you want

### What's the difference between v1 and v2?
V2 is the project I originally planned on doing but was unable to test it due to the API endpoint needed costing $200/month.
V1 is a "next best thing" project that would actually work with the free API. (But to be honest with you it's a bit lame)
