Bot is very simple in nature due to extreme limits of Twitter's Free API.
I will make a branch with the program that I wanted to do. It may or may not work since I will be unable to test it since I don't want to pay $100 per month just for a fun project.
### If you want to use this (for some reason):
- Make a new project/bot/api thing in the twitter developer platform
- Make sure the bot has read/write access in the developer platform console
- Just add your twitter API credentials in config.py
- And if you'd like, customize the tweets in tweets.txt to whatever you want
