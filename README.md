## <ins>THIS LIKELY WILL NOT WORK</ins>
## *This was made as what I originally planned with this bot, I am unable to test it because the cheapest paid Twitter API is $100 per month.*

You can try it if you'd like, but you will need at least the basic API plan or it will give you an error.
If you want a more basic, working one, then go back to https://github.com/b-lamer/BunnyBot

### The function of this bot:
The goal of this bot is to find tweets with words like 'carrot' or 'lettuce' and respond to them as if a rabbit would given pre-selected tweets.
